# Covid-19-Dashboard
A dashboard using Shiny to visualize coronavirus data from Our World in Data  

This is a ShinyApp to visualize the Covid-19 data from Our World in Data. It is currently a very early version with some features missing or may not work properly, but new updates are coming soon! 




## Instructions:

1.) Save all files into the SAME folder on your local drive.

2.) Open the covid_startup.R file and install any missing libraries listed there.

3.) Change the "dir_default" paramter to the path of the folder where you saved all the relevant files.

4.) Run the code! :)

Please note that the program will automatically start downloading the Our World In Data coronavirus dataset, so make sure you have internet connection.
